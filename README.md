# Data Structure Repository

This repository is dedicated to learning, practicing, and implementing data structure algorithms and problem-solving techniques. It is designed to be scalable as more programs and resources are added over time.

---

## Folder Structure

### Programs
- **Java Programs:** Contains implementations of algorithms and data structures in Java.
- **Python Programs:** Contains implementations of algorithms and data structures in Python.
- **Compiled Files:** Contains compiled versions of Java files.
- **Other Files:** Includes IDE configuration files, project metadata, and utility scripts.

---

## Current Highlights

### Java Programs
- Common sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort).
- Custom implementations of data structures (e.g., Linked List).
- Practice problems and utility functions.

### Python Programs
- Various problem-solving scripts and algorithm implementations (e.g., Quick Sort, subsequences).

### Others
- IDE configuration and module setup files for managing the project efficiently.

## How to Run

### Java Files
1. Compile the Java files using `javac`:
   ```bash
   javac <filename>.java
   ```
2. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   java <classname>
   ```

### Python Files
1. Run the Python scripts directly:
   ```bash
   python3 <filename>.py
   ```
